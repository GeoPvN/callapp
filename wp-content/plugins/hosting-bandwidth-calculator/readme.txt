Performs a calculation to see how much monthly hosting bandwidth is needed.

== Description ==
= What does this plugin do? =This plugin calculates the amount of monthly hosting bandwidth you'll need for your site.= How does it work? =It takes the web page size (read from the URL given by the user), and with the user input for monthly page views, it then calculates the monthly hosting bandwidth needed. This is will be displayed as a sidebar widget.

= What is bandwidth? =
Every host offers you bandwidth, but what exactly is it? Not only that, but how much do you really need? Can you get away with 5GB, or should you upgrade to a larger plan that offers 20GB+?

Bandwidth refers to several things. It can refer to the speed at which data moves from a server to a computer (or vice-versa), but that measurement is often used more by ISPs than hosts. Hosting bandwidth is about how much data can be moved from the servers to a computer, regardless of time or speed.

For example, let's say that someone visited your website. Each page is 1MB (for simplicity's sake), and the person visits five pages. This means that the one visitor took up 5MB of your bandwidth.

More bandwidth allows more people to come to your website. It also makes it easier to serve users if you have a larger page with many graphics and videos.

= How is it calculated? =
If you want to know exactly how much bandwidth you need, then you need to use a simple formula. This will ensure that you pick the right hosting package for your website (speaking of which, unlimited hosts typically give you 1GB to 10GB, depending on server size, number of websites per server and how many resources each person is using).

First of all, find out how big your average page is in KB. For this example, let's say that each one is about 250KB.

Next, multiply this by your typical number of visitors per month. If you have 10,000 monthly visitors, then you get about 2.5GB.

Then, multiple this by the number of pages viewed by each person. If each person views about 10 pages, then you'll need about 25GB of bandwidth at bare minimum.

However, you should also leave extra room for growth. It would be a much better idea to get 30-40GB worth of bandwidth.
